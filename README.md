# Cryptocurrencies

The purpose of this repository is to create a report that includes what cryptocurrencies are on the trading market and how they could be grouped to create a classification system for this new investment.

The 3d plot shows that there are 4 clusters without overlap. While there is a noticeable amount of overlap between class 0 and 2 when plotting Total Coin Supply and Total Coins Mined.
